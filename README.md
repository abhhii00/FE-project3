This project was no brainer, from the start. the responsiveness part was the same.
I learnt some new things doing this project like how ::-webkit-scrollbar works and how to change it according to our liking.

i was facing some issues, as my browser (safari) acts differently, when in full screen and i am working on the responsiveness part, whenever i do same changes in the css file either i had to close and then re-open the resposive window or resize the design, then the changes would be applied. but this was nit same when my browser was not full screen mode, it made the change without any sweat. So, i just don't know where its lacking but it worked and that is what i wanted.

lets move forward and learn some new stuf, this side me, abhishek signing off.
